# The arguments to this script will be passed directly to `pytest`. Run this script with `--setup-only` to only
# set up the environment without running tests. For interactive development, google how to activate/use virtual env,
# which will be generated by this script in `./venv`.
# Run this script with `--help` to see the command line reference for the testing project itself.
