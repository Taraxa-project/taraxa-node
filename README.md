# System Requirements
For a full web node, you need at least ...GB of disk space available.
The block log of the blockchain itself is a little over ...GB.
It's highly recommended to run taraxad on a fast disk such as an SSD.
At least ...GB of memory is required for a full web node.
Any CPU with decent single core performance should be sufficient.
Taraxa is constantly growing, so you may find you need more disk space to run a full node.
We are also constantly working on optimizing Taraxa's use of disk space.
