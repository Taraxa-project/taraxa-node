Google how to install other libs for your system.

## Protobuf and gRPC and google_apis
The project uses gRPC and google API, the C++ library for googleapis is unavailable. 
Therefore, googleapis header and source files are included in `google` directory.
To Build googleapis static libs:
```
cd google
make
```
If proto file changed, need to rebuid using: 

`make grpc`

# Run taraxa-node tests:
Tests are under core_tests/
```
make run_test
```
# Run taraxa full node
To run full node requires three files for full node, network and rpc configurations (in JSON format). 

```
make main
```
use `./build/main --help` to check options.

Run example:
```
./build/main --conf_full_node ./core_tests/conf_full_node1.json --conf_network ./core_tests/conf_network1.json --conf_rpc ./core_tests/conf_rpc1.json
```
Please change ip address, binding port, number of threads, etc, in the configuration files accordingly.
