## Version Notes ##
{ major | minor | patch }

_Decide whether this is a major, minor, or patch version change. Major is for backwards incompatible changes (This is only relevant once the service is live and in production and the major version is at least 1. While the major version is 0, it is ok to have backwards incompatible changes in a minor version.). Minor is for additional features. Patch is for bug fixes._

_Describe the changes in this version. This is essentially the details you would include in the squash commit message._

_NOTE: Include the version notes in the squash commit message_
